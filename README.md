This is a thing to replace interviewee photos with robot photos, and interviewee names with made-up words, so we can review them in an unbiased way.  (Sort of like auditioning trombone players behind a screen.)  We at Karmic Labs aim to be as objective as possible in our hiring practices.

And, ROBOTS!!!

Our robots are lovingly delivered by Robohash.org. :<3:
